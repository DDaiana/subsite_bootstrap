            <h3>My Old Dutch</h3>
            <p>
              It could be easy to sniff at My Old Dutch, with its bright orange
              frontage, tiny yet strangely comfortable wooden chairs and
              mock-Delftware plates. It is defiantly, sweetly, uncool. But the
              pancakes work. They are the sort you make at home — thicker than
              crepes, eggy and no buttermilk. You get just the one, but it is
              enormous enough to be satisfying without a distended stomach. We
              went for a sweet pancake and chose our own topping: banana, maple
              syrup and cinnamon.

              If you want your pancakes with a side of Instagram likes, Drunch
              is the place for you. Situated just a 30-second walk from the
              madness of Oxford Street (with a second branch near Regent's
              Park), the pretty, upmarket cafe specialises in brunch, and serves
              up some of the best pancakes we've had in London.

            <h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
            <p>
              We first tried to visit The Breakfast Club's Soho joint on a
              Sunday morning. That was a stupid idea (the queue snaking down the
              street). So instead we headed to a branch down a tiny side street
              opposite Liverpool Street station (also the location of the secret
              Smeg fridge that gets you into a cocktail bar) on a Tuesday
              afternoon. Much quieter.

          <h3>Pancakes at Granger & Co</h3>
          <p>
            We went for brunch at Bill Granger's Notting Hill outlet back in
            2013, and still salivate at memories of the honeycomb butter that
            accompanies its ricotta hotcakes. You get three hotcakes, with maple
            syrup and a slab of banana. They are gorgeously fluffy and the
            ricotta gives a deliciously sour note to take the edge off the
            sweet, making them unlike any other pancakes we've found. The place
            gets very busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait.

          <h3>Pancakes at Where The Pancakes Are</h3>
          <p>
            Cutting swiftly to the chase, Where The Pancakes Are sells pancakes.
            No surprises there. But the variety, size and quality on offer may
            be a little more unexpected. Breakfast pancakes, all day pancakes
            and evening pancakes. Buttermilk pancakes, vegan pancakes and Dutch
            baby pancakes (which sort of look like giant Yorkshire puddings).

          <h3>Crepes and galettes at Senzala Creperie</h3>
          <p>
            Hipster gastronomy centre Brixton Village is where you'll find
            Senzala, and it's where you should head if you're vegan but still
            like the taste of pancake. Many of Senzala's galettes (crepes, but
            made with buckwheat flour, which is also gluten-free) are vegan and
            there are vegetarian and vegan savoury toppings available. If you're
            in the mood for something sweet, they've got you covered too —
            fruit, chocolate and caramel flow freely through the menu. Being a
            tad hungover on our visit, we opted for a white crepe with
            caramelised apple, cinnamon, maple syrup and creme fraiche, the
            latter being a stroke of genius; a cool, slightly sharp zest to
            offset the lake of syrup the crepe swims in. And definitely
            recommended as a day-after restorative.
